              Zero Fall Gravity (ZFG) was formed in 2015 by a group of rock and metal enthusiasts keen to bring back the head-banging nostalgic hits of old school rock 'n' roll classics to the local music scene. Some notable gigs that ZFG have played for include SMU's Starry Nite and RWSâ€™ Coliseum Jam 2015, a nation-wide band competition, where they emerged as finalists. Looking to engage the audience with their high-octane energy, ZFG is a band that strives to continually evolve and play to please.
